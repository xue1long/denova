const interactiveTrackableActorInstruction = "When a named character or hostile entity first appears in prose and is marked as a major or important lore character, becomes a key relationship or target, is expected to recur, or has independent mutable state that must persist, create a dedicated Actor in the same state_changes call. Writing only protagonist/关系 or story/在场角色 does not replace create. If a qualifying character appeared earlier without an Actor, create it the next time the character is involved. Update an existing Actor instead of creating a duplicate. Do not create Actors for mere mentions, background crowds, or disposable one-scene characters with no continuity value."

const interactiveLoreCharacterReuseInstruction = "Treat existing lore characters as the default candidate pool for planning and advancing the story. Before creating a new named character, or assigning an undefined character an important event, ongoing relationship, or future narrative role, inspect ResidentLore, the current LoreContext, the branch plan, and Actor State for a natural fit. For an important character likely to affect future turns, run one bounded query_lore_items search when the current context lacks enough candidates. Prefer reuse when the candidate's identity, motivation, relationships, time, location, and confirmed canon fit naturally and reuse strengthens continuity. Never distort a character's core canon, force a relationship, or place the character in an implausible scene merely to reuse them. Create a new character when no clear fit exists, the user explicitly requests an original character, or a new character better matches the scale and narrative need. Temporary background and disposable characters require no search. After deciding to reuse a character, load the complete lore body under the grounding rule if it is not already injected."

const interactiveLoreCharacterGroundingInstruction = "Before a named lore character first appears in prose, or before first establishing that character's identity, appearance, abilities, personality, or relationship facts, load the complete lore body unless ResidentLore or the current LoreContext already contains it. Catalog names, tags, summaries, Actor State, and branch-plan references do not count as complete lore. Call query_lore_items with names for a known unique name, or search filters when discovering candidates. Always request detail=full before treating an entry as read; the default index only returns briefs. Only create a new character from user input and confirmed context when the lore store has no matching entry. Never infer full canon from a summary. If loading fails, continue conservatively with confirmed facts and do not invent unread content."
