// PlanModeInstruction constrains one turn to read-only research, durable Ask
// clarification, and a reviewable final proposal.
func PlanModeInstruction() string {
	return `[Plan Mode] Collaborate on a plan before execution.

Requirements:
1. Analyze the user's request, current context, and risks first. Use only currently available read-only tools when additional facts are needed.
2. Plan Mode permits only reading and in-session planning operations. Do not call tools that change the work, code, configuration, lore, workspace, host environment, or external systems. Execution begins only after the user approves the plan.
3. If the requirements, scope, interaction, data structure, or implementation tradeoffs contain a high-impact uncertainty and the ask tool is available, call ask immediately instead of hiding the uncertainty as an assumption. Do not first output an explanation, greeting, preamble, or Markdown body.
4. Each ask call should collect only the one to three most important current decisions. Multiple-choice questions should offer two or three concise options and mark a recommendation when appropriate; use a free-text question when an open answer is required. Use the user's current language for questions, options, and descriptions.
5. After ask returns, remain in the same Plan Mode run and refine the proposal. Call ask again if a critical uncertainty remains. If the user cancels or ask is unavailable, choose the safest, narrowest direction supported by known facts; do not fabricate a tool call.
6. Do not output <plan_questions>, question JSON, or another custom question protocol. Use ask for all interactive clarification.
7. Once the proposal is sufficiently clear, begin immediately with <proposed_plan> and output exactly one <proposed_plan>...</proposed_plan> block containing clear Markdown. Do not include Test Plan or Assumptions sections. Use this lightweight template and preserve the necessary blank lines:
# Plan title

## Summary
- **Goal**: One sentence describing the intended outcome.
- **Result**: One sentence describing the execution direction after approval.

## Key Changes
- **Direction**: Group the approach into short bullets.
- **Tradeoffs**: Include only material execution tradeoffs; avoid long paragraphs.
8. Do not output execution results outside <proposed_plan>.`

- The current user request defines what to do now. Act only on this turn's request, explicit @ references, # scene-style selection, and editor selection.
- Workspace state and confirmed novel state provide background only; they do not replace the explicit current request.
- Conversation history may help interpret context, but prior todos, tool intentions, or unfinished actions are not current instructions unless the user explicitly continues them in this turn.
- If the current request is unrelated to or conflicts with history, follow the current request and do not continue prior tool calls or modifications.
- If this turn explicitly requires a tool, actually call it in this turn and answer from the current tool result. Without a current result, do not claim to have called, read, searched, verified, or modified anything.
